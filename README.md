# Tessel Art Experiments

Creating “relatables” for Tessel in preparation for ForwardJS 2, Art Hack, and the rest of my life.

## Summaries

### Neo-Neglect

Working to bring [Timeline of Neglect](http://sarahgp.com/projects/timeline) into the real world, Neo-Neglect is powered when books on a shelf close one of the input switches. The switches connect to both the Internet and Neopixel LEDs vis a Tessel. As books go ignored, their lights slowly go out.

Data writes to [here](http://sarahgp.com/timeline-tessel.html); the history clears every few days.

### Spiny

Spiny was built to let the world know how you're feeling, before you even open your mouth.

When operational, you can [control Spiny from the web](http://sarahgp.com/send-spiny).

### Deluge

Created for [Art Hack Day](http://www.arthackday.net/events/deluge), Deluge uses its motors to let you know when there is too much bluetooth about. The same code also powered "No. 6".
