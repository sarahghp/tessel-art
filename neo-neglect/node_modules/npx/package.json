Neopixels consist of individual [WS2812B](http://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/WS2812B.pdf) chips which are also sold by other vendors like [SeeedStudio](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Digital-RGB-LED-FlexiStrip-60-LED-1-Meter-p-1666.html?cPath=81_79) They're fantastic for creating light shows, art installations, mood lighting, and a ton of other applications.\n\nThis library is rather sparse at the moment and most of the functionality lies within a driver written in the firmware. It assumes a single strand of LEDs connected to pin G4 on the GPIO bank and RGB leds with a 800kHz signal.\n\n##Installation (From original library)\n\nMake sure you have firmware build `0.1.16` or later (```tessel board --version```) installed on Tessel.\n\nThen connect the circuit. You'll need a separate power source because these LEDs require **a lot** of juice. Check out [Adafruit's Powering Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/power) for the best advice. Best practice is to power the neopixels with the 3.7V fixture on the GPIO bank when using Tessel (since it is a 3.3V MCU) but 5V has worked fine in practice. Connect the data wire to G4 on Tessel's GPIO bank and connect GND on Tessel to both GND wires from the neopixels.\n\nWith the following diagram the connections from neopixels to tessel are as follows:\n\nPower -> pin 3\nGND -> pin 1\nData -> pin 20\n\n![GPIO bank with pins labeled](https://s3.amazonaws.com/technicalmachine-assets/doc+pictures/hardware_design_docs/gpio-pins.jpg)\n\n## Getting started\n\nInstall via npm\n\n```\nnpm install npx\n```\n\nRequire npx\n```\nvar Npx = require('npx');\n```\n\nInitialize npx with the number of neopixels attached to your Tessel\n```\nvar npx = new Npx(<number of pixels goes here>);\n```\n\nCreate your first single frame animation and set it to a color!\n```\nvar yourFirstAnimation = npx.newAnimation(1) // initialized with number of animation frames\nvar yourFavoriteHexColor = '#FF00FF';\n\nyourFirstAnimation.setAll(yourFavoriteHexColor);\n\nnpx.play(yourFirstAnimation);\n```\n\nGreat! You're on your way now. Get making awesome hardware hacks and post it to the [projects page](https://projects.tessel.io/projects) when you're done!\n\n## API\n### Npx(totalPixels)\nNew-able constructor function that accepts the total number of pixels attached to Tessel\n\n```\nvar npx = new Npx(totalPixels)\n```\n\n### npx.newAnimation(numberOfFrames)\n\nAccepts an integer number of frames in the animation.\nReturns and Animation object with frames equal to numberOfFrames and pixels initialized to off.\n\n```JavaScript\nvar animation = npx.newAnimation(numberOfFrames);\n```\n###npx.play(animation)\n\nImmediately plays animation.\n```\n\nnpx.play(animation)\n```\n\n###npx.enqueue(animation, delay)\nAccepts an Animation object and delay in milliseconds and puts it into the npx queue to be executed on [npx.run()](#)\nNote that this will not immediately play the animation.\n\n```JavaScript\n// Create new animation\nvar animation = npx.newAnimation(numberOfFrames);\n\n// enqueue blank animation with a 1 second (1000 milliseconds) after it completes\nnpx.enqueue(animation, 1000);\n```\n\n###npx.run()\nPlays all animations in queue in order from first queued to last queued.\n\n```JavaScript\nvar animationRed = npx.newAnimation(1).setAll('#FF0000');\nvar animationWhite = npx.newAnimation(1).setAll('#FFFFFF');\nvar animationBlue = npx.newAnimation(1).setAll('#0000FF');\n\nnpx.enqueue(animationRed,1000)\n   .enqueue(animationWhite,1000)\n   .enqueue(animationBlue,1000)\n   .run();\n```\n\nnote how the neopixels stay blue. This is because neopixels hold their state until they lose power. If you want to turn them off, send a new blank animation to the strip.\n\n##Animation objects\nColors for animations can be of the form [R,G,B] where R,G, and B are values between 0 and 255 (or hex 0x00, 0xFF).\n\nAlternatively colors may be CSS hex colors '#FFFFFF' Though at the moment CSS hex colors must be written out completely '#FFF' will not work.\n\n###Properties\n\n - framelength: number of neopixels attached to Tessel.\n - buffer: the raw Buffer object. Contains animation data.\n - frames.length: number of animation frames in animation.\n\n###Functions\n\n####setAll(color, frame)\nSets all pixels in one frame to a color. If no frame is specified it will set it for all frames.\n\n####setPixel(index, color, frame)\nSets single pixel to a color in a specific animation frame. If no frame is specified it will set it for all frames.\n\n####setPattern(arrayOfColors, frame)\nSets all pixels in one frame to a color.If no frame is specified it will set it for all frames.\n\n##TODO:\n - Implement on Animation:\n    - pattern (colorArray, brightness)\n    - pulse (color, brightness)\n",
